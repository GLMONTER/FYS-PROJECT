		NOTES
------------------------
1.) the variable currentSpeedText can be updated with its .changeText(text) function
	- in the logic loop, update the text to whatever it receives from the GPS
		- I added a function called getSpeed() which returns whatever the GPS reads.
			- This function needs to be done still
